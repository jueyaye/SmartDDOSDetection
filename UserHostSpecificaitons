Just Client or Client + Server

How many clients should be deployed (number or percentage). Only one server is ever deployed

Distance between clients and server?

How often should the module be run?

When should the module first start running?

What class is the module defined in?

What default transport protocol should be used? TCP, UDP, custom/raw

What default Internet protocol should be used? IPv4, IPv6, custom/raw


Option to just run your own set of commands or own custom file on a client or server if they want.



User can specify what modules they want, and can name modules we provide. Everything MUST have
a default value, meaning users can stop at just saying they want to simulate a set of modules,
or they can be specific


Ideally we ship with A http request, an ICMP host, and one or two attackers
